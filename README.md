# Foosball-League-Table-System

This is code I wrote for a foosball league we have at work. Players send their games with points to a group chat where I add the information into a google docs form. I download the results from the table at the end of the day and run this code on it to get a ranking table, and individual stats for each player in the league. I also added a feature to be able to search for all the games that were added on a specific day, to see all the games played that day and the results of that game.

I could have made it using two dimensional lists but i found it a bit easier to understand with seperate lists. its also not the most readable code in the world so i will have to add comments and explain the code.
